## Notes
- As mentioned in the interview instructions, I focused on functionality and kept styling to a bare minimum using inline styles. Please focus on functionality and ignore the appearance ðŸ˜Š
- Unit tests are included to cover basic functionality, aiming to validate the minimum scenarios.

## Trade-off
FE
- I used inline styles for minimal styling. However, for a more refined appearance, I would switch to a proper styling solution if needed.

State Management
- Initially, I used `useState` and `props` for state management. However, as the app grew, I found props drilling for shared states (Cart and Products) across components. To address this, I transitioned to using `Context`. While Redux could be considered, I don't think it's necessary for this one. If the app expands to handle different product types (e.g. bicycles, scooters, roller skates), `Redux` would be a better choice.

Local storage for Cart Items
- To persist the cart state after closing the browser, I used local storage. `sessionStorage` wasn't sufficient, as I needed a more permanent solution with key-value pairs. As the application scales, this approach can still be used to minimize server calls and improve performance.

BE
- While I'm more familiar with GraphQL, I used REST APIs here since they were quicker to implement.
- I initially modified the mock data directly for adding, updating, and deleting. While refactoring, I tried copying the mock data to avoid direct modification. However, this caused issues where the changes didn't persist after refreshing the page. As a result, I decided to continue modifying the mock data directly.

Monolithic Architecture
- I chose a monolithic architecture at this stage, which is fine for the current scale of the project. Microservices could be considered if the app grows significantly.

DB
- I didn't use an actual database connection but opted for mock data in JSON format for quicker implementation.

Page Rendering
- Considering scalability and SEO for a commercial website, I would consider implementing Server-Side Rendering or a hybrid solution, especially if the website needs to handle dynamic, customized parts.


## Improvements I could make 
- Implement E2E tests with Cypress.js from a user's perspective, as well as integration tests to validate interactions between different parts.
- Modularize components to make them more reusable (e.g. Input).
- Improve error handling to make it more user-friendly.
- Focus on styling, responsive design, and accessibility improvements.
- Enhance validation (e.g. Input) and make it more user-friendly.
